# 🏥 Hospital Management System (Console-Based)
📌 Project Overview

The Hospital Management System is a console-based Java application that helps manage basic hospital operations. It provides features to manage patients, doctors, and appointments directly from the terminal. This project is designed as a simple implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and file/database handling concepts in Java.
